# Most homebuyers in the U.S. use mortgages to purchase their homes. However, many others use alternative financing arrangements, such as rent-to-own, that research indicates are generally riskier, more costly, and subject to far weaker consumer protections and regulatory oversight than traditional mortgages.1 Evidence suggests that a shortage of small mortgages, those for less than $150,000, may be driving some home borrowers (i.e., people who purchase a home with financing) who could qualify for a mortgage into these alternative arrangements.2 And other factors related to a home’s habitability and the ownership of the land beneath a manufactured home—the modern version of a mobile home—can make certain homes ineligible for mortgage financing altogether.3

# Despite the evidence of potential consumer harm, little is known about the prevalence of alternative financing in the U.S., primarily because no systematic national data collection exists. The U.S. Census Bureau collected data on the number of Americans who reported using certain types of arrangements until 2009, and in 2019, the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies analyzed alternative financing in selected states that require public record-keeping, but a persistent lack of data has prevented regulators and policymakers from understanding the full scope and scale of this market.4

# To help address this evidence gap, The Pew Charitable Trusts conducted a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults that examined the prevalence of alternative financing and borrower demographics. (See the separate appendix for full survey methodology.) The survey’s key findings are:

# Approximately 1 in 5 home borrowers—about 36 million Americans—have used alternative financing at least once in their adult lives.
# Of those, 22% have used more than one type of alternative arrangement across multiple home purchases, which suggests that some borrowers face repeated barriers to mortgage financing.
# Use of alternative financing varied by race and ethnicity and was highest among Hispanic borrowers.
# Roughly 1 in 15 current home borrowers—around 7 million U.S. adults—currently use alternative financing.
# Among borrowers with active home financing debt, those with annual household incomes below $50,000 were more likely to use alternative financing.
# These findings underscore the urgent need for better national and state data collection that can enable regulators to fully understand the prevalence of alternative financing arrangements and ensure that tens of millions of Americans, especially those from minority and low-income communities, are not overlooked in policy decisions affecting home borrowers. This brief looks closely at the survey findings, their implications for homeownership and family financial well-being, and how federal and state policies intersect with the alternative financing market.

# What is alternative financing?
# Typical alternative financing arrangements, such as land contracts, seller-financed mortgages, lease-purchase agreements, and personal property loans, differ from mortgages in important ways. For the purposes of this analysis, a mortgage is a real estate purchase credit agreement that typically involves a third-party lender who has no prior or other interest in the property separate from the loan and must comply with federal and state regulations. In mortgage transactions, title—that is, full legal ownership of the property as documented in a deed—transfers from seller to buyer at the same time the loan is initiated. By contrast, certain common alternative arrangements, for example land contracts, are not subject to significant regulations, and in purchases using these types of financing, the seller—and not the buyer as in a mortgage transaction—keeps the deed to the property for the duration of the financing term. And because many jurisdictions do not consider buyers to be homeowners if they do not officially hold title and have the deed in hand, this structure can create legal ambiguity and make it difficult for buyers to establish clear ownership or know with certainty who is responsible for property taxes and maintenance.

# Although the rights and protections afforded to mortgage borrowers can provide useful comparisons for understanding the risks that accompany alternative financing, not all financially qualified borrowers can get a mortgage, because of the shortage of small mortgages and because some kinds of properties are not mortgage-eligible. For example, some homes may not meet required habitability standards, such as having certain utility connections or a fully finished kitchen or bathroom, and manufactured homes are often titled as personal property, which is movable property such as a car or a refrigerator, rather than real property, also called real estate, which includes land and any permanent structure on it.5 The most common alternative arrangements are:

# Land contracts. In these arrangements, also called “contracts for deed” or “installment sales contracts,” the seller extends credit directly to the buyer, who then pays regular installments on the debt often for an agreed-upon time period, without the involvement of a third-party lender. Some buyers refer to their contract payments as “rent,” though—as with a mortgage—at least some portion of the payment goes toward the purchase price for the home as dictated by the contract terms. Unlike a mortgage, however, the deed does not transfer to the buyer at the outset in most states; instead, the seller retains full legal ownership of the property until the final payment is made, leaving the buyer without clear rights to either the home or the equity that has accrued.6 Among alternative financing arrangements, land contracts have received the most attention from academics and legislators.
# Lease-purchase agreements. Under these arrangements, commonly referred to as “rent-to-own” or “lease with option to purchase,” the seller is also the landlord, and the buyer occupies the property as a tenant and typically pays an upfront fee or down payment in exchange for the option to purchase the home within a designated period. If the buyer exercises that option, a portion of the buyer’s previous monthly payments, which often exceed market rent for a comparable property, may also be applied toward the down payment for purchase. Then, either the seller or a financial institution extends credit to the buyer for the balance to be repaid over time, and usually the deed transfers at the time the loan is originated. However, if the buyer is unable or unwilling to finalize the transaction, the terms of the lease-purchase agreement may allow the seller to keep some or all of the buyer’s payments.

# Buyers and landlords often describe lease-purchase agreements as a way for tenants to improve their credit scores, build a credit history, and save for a down payment, but little is known about how many lease-purchase buyers ultimately achieve homeownership, continue renting, or withdraw from the deal without exercising their option to buy.
# Personal property loans. These financing products, also known as “home only” or “chattel” loans, are used to buy manufactured homes and are frequently issued by subsidiary lenders of manufactured home builders, although some banks, credit unions, and other lenders also offer this type of financing. Personal property loans typically have much higher interest rates and shorter terms than comparably sized mortgages, resulting in more expensive monthly payments and more interest paid over the life of the loan.7 In addition, personal property loan borrowers have fewer protections in default: In many states, lenders can quickly repossess homes bought with personal property loans, because they are not subject to the foreclosure process required for mortgages.8

# When borrowers purchase manufactured housing with these loans, they are buying their homes as personal rather than real property, and only the structures—not the land beneath—are included in the titles and paid for with the loans. By contrast, in real property transactions, the home and land are titled together and can be financed jointly with a mortgage. Although 73% of personal property loan borrowers rent the land under their homes and face associated risks—unique among homeowners—such as sharp land rent increases and the possibility of being evicted, the remaining 27% own their land and could be eligible for mortgages, assuming they meet underwriting requirements. 9 However, to get a mortgage, these landowners would first need to have the home and land retitled together as real rather than personal property. And depending on state laws, such title changes can be difficult or impossible to accomplish, leaving some landowning homebuyers no choice but to finance their manufactured home purchase with a personal property loan.10
# Seller-financed mortgages. In these arrangements, the seller also acts as the lender, directly extending credit to the buyer to purchase the home, with no third-party lender involved. The deed to the home transfers to the buyer at the start of the agreement—just as with a traditional mortgage—giving the buyer full ownership rights while the loan is repaid over time. But almost no states have enacted laws for seller-financed mortgages, and federal rules apply only to sellers who finance more than three properties per 12-month period.11 These limited protections generally leave buyers without clear recourse if the seller has not taken steps to ensure that the home is habitable, the contract terms are fair, and the title has no competing claims.
# All of these arrangements fall under the rubric of alternative financing, but the required contractual provisions and applicable consumer protections for each vary widely from state to state. In general, research has shown that alternative arrangements are associated with higher long-term costs, less favorable contract terms, and an increased risk of losing home equity compared with commensurate mortgages.12

# Approximately 36 million home borrowers have used alternative financing
# Pew’s survey found that, although most of the roughly 171 million U.S. adults who have ever borrowed to buy a home have used traditional mortgages, about 36 million Americans, or 1 in 5 home borrowers, have used alternative financing at least once—and many have used both at different times.13 (See Figure 1.)

# Personal property loans are the most common type of alternative arrangement; about 11% of home borrowers have used them to buy a home.14 Much more is known about these loans than other alternative arrangements, because the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires lenders who make personal property loans to report details for each loan application to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). That data shows that, compared with manufactured home buyers who obtain mortgages, personal property loan borrowers have similar financial characteristics but pay much higher interest rates.15 For example, over the life of a $100,000 home loan, a personal property loan borrower would pay a 7.75% interest rate, twice that of a mortgage borrower’s 3.75% and costing almost $48,000 more.16

# After personal property loans, the survey found that other common types of alternative financing are lease-purchase agreements (6%), seller-financed mortgages (6%), and land contracts (5%). Most research into the prevalence, terms, and outcomes of these alternative arrangements has focused on land contracts, because some state and local governments require public recording of land contract transactions while almost none do for seller-financed mortgages or lease-purchase agreements.17

# Additionally, and in part because of a lack of consistent national regulatory or statutory conventions defining these three types of alternative arrangements, such as exists for mortgages, the language used to describe them varies across the U.S., and unscrupulous sellers can use the resulting lack of clarity to their advantage, referring to arrangements by other names to circumvent laws. For example, in states with strong land contract laws but weak renter protections, land contract sellers could skirt the consumer protections by marketing their financing to buyers as rent-to-own arrangements, while still structuring the financing as land contracts.18

# Further, the available evidence indicates that lease-purchase agreements, seller-financed mortgages, and land contracts often share risky features that lead buyers to pay higher costs and can result in default and potentially loss of the home and all funds paid. For example, sellers may inflate their asking prices for a property because third-party appraisals are not required; they may insist that buyers pay for repairs to properties for which the buyers do not hold clear title; or they may evict buyers without first offering buyers the opportunity to catch up on missed payments.19 Because seller-financed mortgages and lease-purchase agreements are about as common as the better-studied land contracts and can lead to similarly harmful outcomes, they merit more research attention.


# Among borrowers who have used alternative financing, 22% have used more than one of the arrangements that Pew studied. (See Figure 2.) And although the available evidence is insufficient to explain why borrowers use these alternatives, it does indicate that even financially capable borrowers face systemic barriers to accessing mortgages. 

# The increased costs and risks associated with alternative financing raise concerns about their recurring use by the same households. For example, legal aid advocates and researchers have called attention to profit-driven “churning,” which occurs when an owner initiates the sale of the same house repeatedly, receiving deposits or other unsecured payments from successive buyers under alternative agreements that, because of the lack of regulatory controls on such arrangements, never result in any of the buyers achieving full ownership or recouping their investments.20 However, little is known about how often this occurs and at what point these agreements typically collapse, so more research is warranted. 


# Use of alternative financing varies by race and ethnicity 
# Among home borrowers, the likelihood of using alternative arrangements varies by race and ethnicity. Hispanic households that have financed a home purchase are more likely to have used alternative financing compared with other households: 34% of Hispanic borrowers reported using at least one alternative arrangement compared with 23% of non-Hispanic Black borrowers and 19% of non-Hispanic White borrowers. (See Figure 3.) 

# Other research aligns with these findings and offers additional insights. For example, CFPB found that, among buyers of manufactured homes, Hispanic, Black, and Indigenous families were more likely than other households to use personal property loans.21 Further, an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis found that Indigenous people living on reservation trust lands were more likely than their neighbors who do not live on trust land to apply for personal property loans to purchase manufactured homes—at least in part because of obstacles to using trust land as collateral for a mortgage.22 And the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta found that, from 2001 to 2009, Hispanic and Black households were more likely than other households to use land contracts to purchase a home.23 


# These disparities in the use of alternative financing may reflect racial and ethnic inequalities in mortgage approval rates and loan costs: Historically, Hispanic and Black borrowers have been more likely to have mortgage applications denied and to receive high-cost mortgages if their applications are approved.24 

# Approximately 7 million adults currently use alternative financing
# Among the roughly 114 million adults who have debt on their home, Pew’s survey found that about 7 million, or 1 in 15 current home borrowers, currently use one of these arrangements.25 

# Use of alternative financing is higher among borrowers with lower incomes
# The survey found that lower-income borrowers are more likely than those with higher incomes to use alternative arrangements, making financially vulnerable families less likely to benefit from the consumer protections granted to federally regulated mortgages. Among all current borrowers, those with annual household incomes under $50,000 were more than seven times as likely to be using alternative financing instead of mortgages to buy their homes compared with individuals with annual household incomes above $50,000. (See Figure 4.)

# Some low-income households may use alternative arrangements because they cannot qualify for mortgages under current underwriting standards. For instance, low-income families are more likely than higher-income households to have volatile incomes and little or no credit history, both of which are barriers to being approved for a mortgage.26 Further, underwriting practices have not historically recognized borrowers’ demonstrated ability to make regular monthly rent payments as evidence that they could manage comparable mortgage obligations, although Fannie Mae did launch an underwriting program in September 2021 to expand mortgage eligibility to households with rental payment histories, which should help address this gap.27 

# However, several other factors, including habitability standards for low-cost homes, manufactured home titling issues, and the shortage of small mortgages, also may drive borrowers into alternative financing, and some may not seek mortgages at all. More research is needed to understand how borrowers enter alternative arrangements and what roles mortgage eligibility and access play.


# Understanding alternative financing can help policymakers better protect, support consumers 
# Research suggests that the harms associated with some alternative financing arrangements persist largely because of the lack of consumer protections, particularly contract recording requirements, or the insufficient enforcement of such protections where they do exist.28 Recording an alternative financing contract with a local government clerk or records office provides documentation of agreements made between seller and buyer and of the buyer’s rights to the home.29 Pew-commissioned research from the National Consumer Law Center found that about a dozen states have enacted laws or ordinances mandating public recording of land contracts and that none have done so for seller-financed mortgages.30 But statutory requirements aside, legal aid providers have observed that sellers sometimes choose to record alternative financing arrangements to protect their ownership interest if a borrower defaults.31 

# However, when alternative financing arrangements are not recorded, the resulting lack of documentation can prevent lawyers, housing advocates, government officials, and other stakeholders from determining who holds legal ownership of a property. This, in turn, can obscure the assignment of responsibilities, such as paying taxes or ensuring habitability, as well as the distribution of rights and benefits, including eligibility for homeowner tax exemptions, natural disaster relief, or insurance claim payouts.

# Without public recording, lawmakers cannot know how many households use alternative financing or appropriately allocate financial aid or other resources when needed. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for instance, federal and state governments have provided financial assistance and eviction protections to homeowners and renters. But the legal ambiguity associated with some alternative arrangements has meant that borrowers were often ineligible for those supports, and given the disparities in alternative financing use, this ineligibility is likely to have compounded hardships for the low-income and minority families who were the most likely to struggle financially during the pandemic.32

# Some recent policies have explicitly included alternative financing borrowers alongside mortgage borrowers. For example, the U.S. Department of the Treasury released guidance in August 2021 to clarify that its Homeowner Assistance Fund can provide financial assistance to homeowners with land contracts or personal property loans for manufactured homes, as well as those with mortgages.33 However, the guidance leaves it to state officials to determine the number of borrowers in their states who are eligible to receive the funding. Some states, such as New York and Wisconsin, have taken proactive steps to include land contract and personal property loan borrowers in their Homeowner Assistance Fund distribution plans. But in most states, without recording requirements to document borrowers and policy action to expand eligibility, many of the 7 million people who currently use alternative financing might not receive funds for which they would otherwise qualify should they need assistance. In addition, the Federal Emergency Management Agency in September 2021 provided mechanisms for manufactured home owners, who do not have a deed or similar traditional documentation, to prove ownership.34 These policy changes reflect a growing recognition at the federal and state levels of the need to address the challenges faced by home borrowers who use alternative financing.

# Conclusion
# This new survey data shows that nationwide, tens of millions of families have used alternative financing arrangements at some point to pursue their goals of homeownership, but also that some borrowers are more likely than others to do so. The findings highlight disparities by race, ethnicity, and income that reflect broader inequalities in the mortgage market. 

# State and federal policymakers have proposed legislation, regulation, and programmatic guidelines in recent years that have sought to include alternative financing. But scarce information about the prevalence of these arrangements as well as who uses them and why, among other challenges, has limited the reach of those efforts, leaving millions of borrowers at risk. The data presented in this brief can begin to fill that gap and help policymakers craft better strategies to protect all home borrowers.

Manufactured houses, unlike their mobile predecessors, are built to robust federal quality standards that may even exceed local standards for site-built homes. Manufactured housing is eligible for mortgage financing when owned as real property—where the home and land are titled together. However, when manufactured homes are titled as personal property separate from the land beneath, buyers are not eligible for a mortgage.

# ram.memory.add_product_memory('''Obtaining a mortgage is a crucial step in purchasing your first home, and there are several factors for choosing the most appropriate one. While the myriad of financing options available for first-time homebuyers can seem overwhelming, taking the time to research the basics of property financing can save you a significant amount of time and money.

# Understanding the market where the property is located, and whether it offers incentives to lenders, may mean added financial perks for you. And by taking a close look at your finances, you can ensure that you are getting the mortgage that best suits your needs. This article outlines some of the important details that first-time homebuyers need to make their big purchase.

# KEY TAKEAWAYS
# When applying for a mortgage, lenders will evaluate your creditworthiness and your ability to repay based on your income, assets, debts, and credit history.
# As you choose a mortgage, you’ll have to decide between a fixed or floating rate, the number of years to pay off your mortgage, and the size of your down payment.
# Depending on your circumstances, you may be eligible for more favorable terms through a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan, a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loan, or another type of government-guaranteed loan.
# As a first-time homebuyer, you may be eligible for special programs that allow you to access deeply discounted homes and put low or no money down.
# First-Time Homebuyer Requirements
# To be approved for a mortgage, you’ll need to meet several requirements, depending on the type of loan for which you are applying. To be approved specifically as a first-time homebuyer, you’ll need to meet the definition of a first-time homebuyer, which is broader than you may think.

# According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, a first-time homebuyer is someone who meets one of the following criteria:

# Has not owned a principal residence for three years
# Is a single parent who has only owned with a former spouse while married
# Is a displaced homemaker and has only owned with a spouse
# Has only owned a residence not permanently affixed to a foundation
# Is an individual who has only owned a property that was not in compliance with building codes.1
# You’ll generally need to have proof of income for a minimum of two years sufficient to pay the mortgage, a down payment of at least 3.5%, and a credit score of at least 620; however, as a first-time homebuyer, there are programs that can allow you to buy a home with a low income, $0 down, and credit scores as low as 500.
# Loan Types
# Conventional Loans
# Conventional loans are mortgages that are not insured or guaranteed by the federal government. They are typically fixed-rate mortgages. They are some of the most difficult types of mortgages to qualify for because of their stricter requirements: a bigger down payment, higher credit score, lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratios, and the potential for a private mortgage insurance (PMI) requirement. However, if you can qualify for a conventional mortgage, they are usually less costly than loans that are guaranteed by the federal government.

# Conventional loans are defined as either conforming loans or nonconforming loans. Conforming loans comply with guidelines, such as the loan limits set forth by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.2These lenders (and various others) often buy and package these loans, then sell them as securities on the secondary market; however, loans that are sold on the secondary market must meet specific guidelines to be classified as conforming loans.

# The maximum conforming loan limit for a conventional mortgage in 2023 is $726,200, though it can be more for designated high-cost areas. A loan made above this amount is called a jumbo loan, which usually carries a slightly higher interest rate. These loans carry more risk (since they involve more money), making them less attractive to the secondary market.23

# For nonconforming loans, the lending institution that is underwriting the loan, usually a portfolio lender, sets its own guidelines. Due to regulations, nonconforming loans cannot be sold on the secondary market.

# Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Loans
# The Federal Housing Administration (FHA), part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), provides various mortgage loan programs for Americans. An FHA loan has lower down payment requirements and is easier to qualify for than a conventional loan.4

# FHA loans are excellent for first-time homebuyers because, in addition to lower up-front loan costs and less stringent credit requirements, you can make a down payment as low as 3.5%. FHA loans cannot exceed the statutory limits described above.4

#  Upfront fees on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac home loans changed in May 2023. Fees were increased for homebuyers with higher credit scores, such as 740 or higher, while they were decreased for homebuyers with lower credit scores, such as those below 640. Another change: Your down payment will influence what your fee is. The higher your down payment, the lower your fees, though it will still depend on your credit score.5 Fannie Mae provides the Loan-Level Price Adjustments on its website.6
# However, all FHA borrowers must pay a mortgage insurance premium, rolled into their mortgage payments.78 Mortgage insurance is an insurance policy that protects a mortgage lender or titleholder if the borrower defaults on payments, passes away, or is otherwise unable to meet the contractual obligations of the mortgage.

# U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Loans
# The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) guarantees VA loans. The VA does not make loans itself but guarantees mortgages made by qualified lenders. These guarantees allow veterans to obtain home loans with favorable terms (usually without a down payment).9

# In most cases, VA loans are easier to qualify for than conventional loans. Lenders generally limit the maximum VA loan to conventional mortgage loan limits. Before applying for a loan, you’ll need to request your eligibility from the VA. If you are accepted, the VA will issue a certificate of eligibility that you can use to apply for a loan.10

# In addition to these federal loan types and programs, state and local governments and agencies sponsor assistance programs to increase investment or homeownership in certain areas.

# Equity and Income Requirements
# Home mortgage loan pricing is determined by the lender in two ways, and both methods are based on the creditworthiness of the borrower. In addition to checking your FICO score from the three major credit bureaus, lenders will calculate the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio and the debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) to determine the amount that they’re willing to loan to you, plus the interest rate.

# LTV is the amount of actual or implied equity that is available in the collateral being borrowed against. For home purchases, LTV is determined by dividing the loan amount by the purchase price of the home. Lenders assume that the more money you are putting up (in the form of a down payment), the less likely you are to default on the loan. The higher the LTV, the greater the risk of default, so lenders will charge more.11

# For this reason, you should include any type of qualifying income that you can when negotiating with a mortgage lender. Sometimes an extra part-time job or other income-generating business can make the difference between qualifying or not qualifying for a loan, or in receiving the best possible rate. A mortgage calculator can show you the impact of different rates on your monthly payment.

# Calculate Your Monthly Payment
# Your monthly mortgage payment will depend on your home price, down payment, loan term, property taxes, homeowners insurance, and interest rate on the loan (which is highly dependent on your credit score). Use the inputs below to get a sense of what your monthly mortgage payment could end up being.

# Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)
# LTV also determines whether you will be required to purchase the PMI mentioned earlier. PMI helps to insulate the lender from default by transferring a portion of the loan risk to a mortgage insurer. Most lenders require PMI for any loan with an LTV greater than 80%.12

# This translates to any loan in which you own less than 20% equity in the home. The amount being insured and the mortgage program will determine the cost of mortgage insurance and how it’s collected.12

# Most mortgage insurance premiums are collected monthly, along with tax and property insurance escrows. Once LTV is equal to or less than 78%, PMI is supposed to be eliminated automatically.13 You may also be able to cancel PMI once the home has appreciated enough in value to give you 20% home equity and a set period has passed, such as two years.12

# Some lenders, such as the FHA, will assess the mortgage insurance as a lump sum and capitalize it into the loan amount.

#  As a rule of thumb, try to avoid PMI because it is a cost that has no benefit to you.
# There are ways to avoid paying for PMI. One is not to borrow more than 80% of the property value when purchasing a home; the other is to use home equity financing or a second mortgage to put down more than 20%. The most common program is called an 80-10-10 mortgage. The 80 stands for the LTV of the first mortgage, the first 10 stands for the LTV of the second mortgage, and the second 10 represents your home equity.14

# The rate on the second mortgage will be higher than the rate on the first mortgage, but on a blended basis, it should not be much higher than the rate of a 90% LTV loan. An 80-10-10 mortgage can be less expensive than paying for PMI. It also allows you to accelerate the payment of the second mortgage and eliminate that portion of the debt quickly so you can pay off your home early.

# Fixed-Rate Mortgages vs. Floating-Rate Mortgages
# Another consideration is whether to obtain a fixed-rate or floating-rate (also called a variable-rate) mortgage. In a fixed-rate mortgage, the rate does not change for the entire period of the loan. The obvious benefit of getting a fixed-rate loan is that you know what the monthly loan costs will be for the entire loan period. And, if prevailing interest rates are low, then you’ve locked in a good rate for a substantial time.

# A floating-rate mortgage, such as an interest-only mortgage or an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), is designed to assist first-time homebuyers or people who expect their incomes to rise substantially over the loan period. Floating-rate loans usually allow you to obtain lower introductory rates during the first few years of the loan, which allows you to qualify for more money than if you had tried to get a more expensive fixed-rate loan.

# Of course, this option can be risky if your income does not grow in step with the increase in interest rate. The other downside is that the path of market interest rates is uncertain: If they dramatically rise, then your loan’s terms will skyrocket with them.

# How Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (ARMs) Work
# The most common types of ARMs are for one-, five-, or seven-year periods. The initial interest rate is normally fixed for a period of time and then resets periodically, often every month. Once an ARM resets, it adjusts to the market rate, usually by adding some predetermined spread (percentage) to the prevailing U.S. Treasury rate.15

# Although the increase is typically capped, an ARM adjustment can be more expensive than the prevailing fixed-rate mortgage loan to compensate the lender for offering a lower rate during the introductory period.

# Interest-only loans are a type of ARM in which you only pay mortgage interest and not principal during the introductory period until the loan reverts to a fixed, principal-paying loan.

# Such loans can be very advantageous for first-time borrowers because only paying interest significantly decreases the monthly cost of borrowing and will allow you to qualify for a much larger loan; however, because you pay no principal during the initial period, the balance due on the loan does not change until you begin to repay the principal.
# The DSCR determines your ability to pay the mortgage. Lenders divide your monthly net income by the mortgage costs to assess the probability that you will default on the mortgage. Most lenders will require DSCRs of greater than one.

# The greater the ratio, the greater the probability that you will be able to cover borrowing costs and the less risk that the lender assumes. The greater the DSCR, the more likely that a lender will negotiate the loan rate; even at a lower rate, the lender receives a better risk-adjusted return.

#  Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think that you’ve been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps that you can take. One such step is to file a report with either the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or HUD.
# Specialty Programs for First-Time Homebuyers
# In addition to all of the traditional sources of funding, there are several specialty programs for first-time homebuyers.

# Ready Buyer
# The Federal National Mortgage Association’s (Fannie Mae’s) HomePath Ready Buyer program is designed for first-time buyers and provides up to 3% assistance toward closing costs on the purchase of a foreclosed property owned by Fannie Mae. To be eligible for the program, interested buyers have to complete a mandatory home-buying education course prior to making an offer.16
# Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
# Every first-time homebuyer is eligible to take up to $10,000 out of a traditional individual retirement account (IRA) without paying the 10% penalty for early withdrawal.17 The limit is per individual, so a couple could withdraw up to $10,000 each from their own IRAs for a total of $20,000 to put down.17

# If a homebuyer wants to withdraw up to $10,000 for a home purchase from a Roth IRA, they can do so without penalty, as long as they’ve had the Roth account for at least five years. Note that this only exempts you from the penalty for early withdrawal. If you withdraw from a traditional IRA, you will still have to pay income tax on the money withdrawn.1817

# Down Payment Assistance Programs
# Many states have down payment assistance programs for first-time buyers. Eligibility varies from state to state, but generally, these programs are geared toward lower-income individuals and public servants. HUD maintains a list of programs for each state.19
# What Credit Score Is Needed to Buy a House?
# Most conventional mortgages require a credit score of 620 or greater; however, Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans can accept a credit score as low as 500 with a 10% down payment, or as low as 580 with a 3.5% down payment.4

# What Is the Average Interest Rate for a First-Time Homebuyer?
# Interest rates depend on a variety of factors, including credit scores, down payment percentage, type of loan, and market conditions. There is no data to indicate that first-time homebuyers with similar creditworthiness and circumstances pay higher or lower interest rates than experienced homebuyers.

# Are There Any State Tax Credits for First-Time Homebuyers?
# While the first-time homebuyer tax credit was eliminated at the federal level in 2010, several states still offer state tax credits for first-time homebuyers. Additionally, some municipalities and counties offer property tax reductions for first-time homebuyers in their first year. Check with a local tax professional to see what you may be eligible for in your area.

# The Bottom Line
# If you’re looking for a home mortgage for the first time, you may find it difficult to sort through all the financing options. Take time to decide how much home you can actually afford and then finance accordingly.

# If you can afford to put down a substantial amount or have enough income to create a low LTV, then you will have more negotiating power with lenders and the most financing options. If you push for the largest loan, then you may be offered a higher risk-adjusted rate and private mortgage insurance.

# Weigh the benefit of obtaining a larger loan with the risk. Interest rates typically float during the interest-only period and will often adjust in reaction to changes in market interest rates. Also, consider the risk that your disposable income won’t rise along with the possible increase in borrowing costs.

# A good mortgage broker or mortgage banker should be able to help steer you through all the different programs and options, but nothing will serve you better than knowing your priorities for a mortgage loan.''')
